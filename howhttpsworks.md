### [Why do we need HTTPS](https://howhttps.works/why-do-we-need-https/)
* **Privacy** - using http someone can eavesdrop on your messages, as they are not encrypted
* **Integrity** - "man-in-the-middle attack" threat
* **Identification** - A digital signature attached to a message can identify the sender.
* HTTPS, via SSL certificates, ensures you are connected exactly with the receiver you would expect.
