## MIT Blockchain course notes
### [Money, Ledgers & Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/5auv_xrvoJk)
* A **ledger** is a way to record ecomonic activity or financial relationships
* **Types of ledgers** Transactions vs Balance. General vs Supporting (hierarchy). Central bank is like a general ledger for money, and every commercial bank in essence keep sub-ledger for money, but they don't have control of master(general) ledger.
* Bitcoin is a transaction ledger. Ethereum is a balance ledger.
* Payment systems - a method to amend and record changes in ledgers for money
